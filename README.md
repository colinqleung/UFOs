## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to develop a html site which filtered UFO sightings by date and location. The given data set was filled with UFO sightings with certain descriptions, such as date and location, and by inputting certain constraints the data was sorted and condensed to match the input.

## Results

The UFO sightings data can be sorted by Date, City, State, Country and Shape. One can use the new webpage by entering a specific date in the format (month/day/year), inputting city, state and country by typing the name of the location, and for shape, typing the shape type. Then after entering a specific constraint, the data will only show sightings based on the inputted information. 

## Summary
One drawback of this website is the source of the sighting. There could potentially be one source reporting much of the data which would greatly impact the analysis. For further development, the data should be filtered to limit how many sightings reported by a single source can be included in the overall set. Another further development could be including a duration filter since that information is also included in the dataset.
